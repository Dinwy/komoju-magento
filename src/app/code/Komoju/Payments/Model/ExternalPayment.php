/**
 * The ExternalPayment model is the programmatic access for the external_payment
 * data. The ExternalPayment data serves as a connection between the unique ID
 * passed to Komoju as the external_order_num and the core sales order in Magento.
 *
 * Because it's possible multiple systems can use the same Komoju account just
 * using the order id as the external_order_num could cause some conflicts, since
 * it's just a incrementing number (which is a very common pattern for databases).
 * Since we don't have a way for a system to demarcate itself to Komoju, if one system
 * generated webhooks for an order, the other system would not know if the order is
 * for itself, which could cause orders to be set to the incorrect state. To deal with
 * this the ExternalPayment model was created, which would allow for a unique ID to
 * be created, and be linked to the relevant order in Magento.
